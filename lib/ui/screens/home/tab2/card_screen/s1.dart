The Health Advisor will also explain about your diagnosis, teach you about safe sex and work out how best to treat any contacts.A complete set of results will be through in 2 weeks. It is the clinic policy to contact patients by phone if any results are positive, please ensure your contact details are correct. If your results are negative you will not be contacted, no news is good news.For most people a once off visit is all that is required. However some patients may require a return appointment for review. Your HCP on the day will advise you if you need to make this ",
